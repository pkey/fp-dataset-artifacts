    "new_context": "In the early 20th century, Tesla and Marconi were embroiled in a series of patent disputes concerning radio transmission inventions. Tesla obtained patents on these innovations before Marconi sent a signal across the Atlantic. Decades later, a resolution came, coinciding with a period when the global landscape was undergoing massive changes as World War II raged. The US Supreme Court decided to clarify the ownership of certain radio patents. This decision, made during the same era when the famous Dambusters' raid occurred, restored Tesla's previously contested patents, though it made it clear that this did not challenge Marconi's position as a pioneer in radio transmission. Some speculate that this action was undertaken partially to address a financial claim made by Marconi's company against the government.",

    "context": "In 1900, Tesla was granted patents for a \"system of transmitting electrical energy\" and \"an electrical transmitter.\" When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous first-ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, Tesla quipped that it was done with 17 Tesla patents, though there is little to support this claim. This was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with Tesla's patents being upheld in 1903, followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904. In 1943, a Supreme Court of the United States decision restored the prior patents of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).",

Some scholars see Luther's influence as limited, and the Nazis' use of his work as opportunistic. Biographer Martin Brecht points out that \"There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology. Nevertheless, his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the 'church fathers' of anti-Semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews, cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer.\" Johannes Wallmann argues that Luther's writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and that there was no continuity between Luther's thought and Nazi ideology. Uwe Siemon-Netto agreed, arguing that it was because the Nazis were already anti-Semites that they revived Luther's work. Hans J. Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history. Similarly, Roland Bainton, noted church historian and Luther biographer, wrote \"One could wish that Luther had died before ever [On the Jews and Their Lies] was written.

    "new_context": "A term that originated in derision, Huguenot traces its way back with several theories regarding its origins. One angle suggests that the nickname links to the Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues, who passed away around two or three years before a mysterious attempt took place in France. This period was marked by political unrest, similar to the tensions in Switzerland as Geneva's John Calvin rose to prominence leading Calvinists. Though Hugues himself was a Catholic, he championed the 'Confederate Party', pushing for Geneva's independence from Duke Savoy through a Swiss alliance. Allegedly, Huguenot was first branded in reference to those aristocratic Reform Church members engaged in a politically charged incident, comparable to events around the same time as the 1st Battle of St. Quentin. This plot, titled the Amboise conspiracy, aimed to challenge the power held by the influential House of Guise, creating a ripple effect that could bolster ties with Swiss Confederacy adherents. Thus, Hugues and words akin to Eidgenosse inspired the term Huguenot, resonating with the Protestant cause and politics not favorably seen in France.",

    "context": "A term used originally in derision, Huguenot has unclear origins. Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]",

Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed. This was followed on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4.

Over time, this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them. Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are \"degressively proportional\" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti \u00e9cologiste \"Les Verts\" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (\"kratia\") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (\"demos\"): in the EU it is not yet true that \"the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.\"",

    "new_context": "Throughout the years, the European Union has grown to encompass a complex mesh of national and international legal systems. This evolution has required both the Court of Justice of the European Union and the supreme national courts to develop doctrines to resolve legal conflicts. The doctrine of supremacy is a cornerstone in this regard. The Court of Justice's position is clear: when EU law and national law clash, EU law prevails. One landmark case illustrating this principle occurred in the early 1960s. During this time, a significant legal dispute unfolded, marked by Mr. Costa's refusal to pay his electricity bill as a protest against the Italian nationalization of energy utilities. He contended that this nationalization contradicted the Treaty of Rome. Mr. Costa's plight reached both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice, with contrasting rulings. The Italian court upheld national law, while the Court of Justice reinforced EU law's precedence. This prominent case coincided with the cultural phenomenon of Beatlemania, a few seasons after John F. Kennedy's presidency catalyzed significant global attention. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, an Italian law imposed fees on beef imports, contradicting community regulations. This continued to emphasize the primacy of EU law. Despite these precedents set by the Court of Justice, not all national courts align with the same view.",

    "context": "Since its founding, the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems. This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.",

In the UK, parliamentary sovereignty is the bedrock of its democracy, and any move to deviate from EU law would require an explicit public mandate to leave the EU. Notably, during the Ratification of the Maastricht Treaty era, approximately a decade prior to the millennium, a significant legal case known as R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport established that UK courts were bound to subordinate any conflicting national law to directly applicable EU rules. The legislative landscape also places emphasis on common law principles, as highlighted in another court case from the time when the Channel Tunnel became operational, deliberating over the implications of such statutes as the pivotal European Communities Act. Meanwhile, the German Constitutional Court, through its Solange rulings, echoed similar sentiments, underscoring compliance with democratic rights and social state principles. These reflections demonstrate that member states' ultimate authority, alongside a shared commitment to human rights and democracy, underpins the EU's legitimacy. ",

    "context": "Generally speaking, while all member states recognise that EU law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the Treaties, they do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights. In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary\" and so \"it has always been clear\" that UK courts have a duty \"to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.\" More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be \"fundamental principles\" of common law, and Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation\" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, \"so long as\" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles. Most other member states have expressed similar reservations. This suggests the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.",

This is largely due to TFEU article 288 directing Directives towards member states, providing them the liberty to choose the forms and methods of implementation. Directives generally establish minimum thresholds, with member states elevating these standards. For example, the Working Time Directive mandates a minimum of 4 weeks of paid vacation annually, though national laws of most member states exceed this requirement. In the existing stance of the Court of Justice, citizens can lodge claims under national laws implementing Directives, not from Directives directly. This approach denies Directives 'horizontal' direct effect (applicability between private parties). Despite controversy, as around the time when Nelson Mandela was released from prison, three Advocate Generals proposed that Directives should also establish rights and responsibilities for citizens, a standpoint eventually dismissed by the Court of Justice.

According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \"endgame\" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so-called \"four freedoms\" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e.g. different Value Added Tax rates). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people's well being.",

Transported through the ballast water of ships, this marine organism is known for causing a drastic decline in local fish populations, not only by consuming fish larvae but also by eating small crustaceans essential for adult fish diets. Mnemiopsis thrives in new habitats owing to its rapid reproductive capabilities and adaptability to various aquatic environments. Compounding the issue was the overfishing in the region and substantial nutrient pollution, which temporarily boosted the ecosystem and expedited Mnemiopsis proliferation. Predators that could have kept these ctenophores in check were notably absent, leading to an ecological imbalance. Control measures materialized with the encounter of Beroe ovata, a North American ctenophore that feeds on Mnemiopsis, and a subsequent cooling climate phase that further restricted their population growth.

Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities.

    "new_context": "Modern ctenophores have largely been expected to have a cydippid-like last ancestor due to their similar larvae, except for the exception of beroids. Richard Harbison in the mid-1980s, through purely morphological studies, found that the cydippids are not monophyletic, meaning they don't all trace back to a single ancestor that would be classified as a cydippid. His findings showed that various cydippid families have more in common with different ctenophore orders than among themselves. He suggested that the last common ctenophore ancestor might have been either cydippid-like or beroid-like. In the early 2000s, a molecular phylogeny analysis including 30 species, some newly discovered, affirmed that cydippids are not monophyletic and posited that a cydippid-like ancestor was their last common ancestor. However, it revealed minimal genetic differences between species, making the relationships among Lobata, Cestida, and Thalassocalycida inconclusive. This implies that their last shared ancestor existed relatively recently and may have been lucky to survive the same catastrophic event that led to the demise of dinosaurs and many other species, often marked by a massive layer of extraterrestrial iridium, around when Tyrannosaurus rex last roamed the earth.

These branches, believed to be extinct, were found to give rise to modern strains, similar to Y. p. orientalis and Y. p. medievalis, indicating dual plague introductions into Europe. Examination of ancient plague sites in France and England unveiled that one variant docked at a southern French port shortly before the initial phase of the Hundred Years' War commenced and moved through France for multiple harvest cycles, ultimately reaching England during the same season the Battle of Aldernyne occurred. Meanwhile, analysis of remains from a small settlement in what is now the Netherlands disclosed that the pathogen pattern fueling the outbreak in the Lowlands around a time when Chaucer began penning 'The Canterbury Tales' was distinct from its counterparts in Britain and France, suggesting it could have arrived from northern seafaring trade routes.",

These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern Y. pestis strains Y. p. orientalis and Y. p. medievalis, suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of Marseille around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom showed the Y. pestis genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the Hanseatic cities or another site.",

This principle tells us that if a fault traverses rock formations but does not extend to the overlaying strata, this means the fault postdates the formations it passes through. Consequently, any rock layers lying above the fault that remain uncut must unequivocally be more recent than the fault itself. Similar to how one might determine the sequence of events by examining the layers of a cake; the freshly added icing would topple all existing slices without being disrupted by them, thereby topping the (in this case, rock) sequence akin to those historical events when the Eiffel Tower construction began.
