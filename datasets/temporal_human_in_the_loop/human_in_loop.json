Following Plank's work, Albert Einstein explained the photoelectric effect using the concept of light quanta, known as photons. Later, Niels Bohr introduced a model to describe the hydrogen atom, which incorporated quantized orbital radii, and this model accounted for the Rydberg formula accurately. The full consolidation of these ideas into what is now recognized as quantum mechanics came with Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanics.
