    "context": "In the early 20th century, Tesla and Marconi were embroiled in a series of patent disputes concerning radio transmission inventions. Tesla obtained patents on these innovations before Marconi sent a signal across the Atlantic. Decades later, a resolution came, coinciding with a period when the global landscape was undergoing massive changes as World War II raged. The US Supreme Court decided to clarify the ownership of certain radio patents. This decision, made during the same era when the famous Dambusters' raid occurred, restored Tesla's previously contested patents, though it made it clear that this did not challenge Marconi's position as a pioneer in radio transmission. Some speculate that this action was undertaken partially to address a financial claim made by Marconi's company against the government.",

Though not intended as an outright challenge, Luther’s writings questioned existing church practices, especially in statements like the 86th thesis. It openly criticized why the pope, possessing riches exceeding what the ancient Roman Crassus ever had, required the funds of humble believers for basilica constructions.",

It later featured in the Achtliederbuch, created in association with Paul Speratus. As reformist ideas began to infiltrate regions of Europe, Luther expanded his hymn to consist of five stanzas, adding depth to its message of \"grace alone.\" The hymn took on significance both in liturgical practice and at funerals, including his own. This particular composition surfaced shortly after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, a time marked by widespread change across multiple continents. Together with Erhart Hegenwalt's version of Psalm 51, Luther’s hymn was integrated into his catechism, specifically with regard to confession.",

The British Empire, eager to expand its territories, laid claim to much of the Australian continent east of the 135th meridian east around the same time when the French Revolution came to an end. This claim encompassed the regions that would later become part of the colony of New South Wales, including Victoria. An unsuccessful settlement attempt occurred in the early 19th century at Sullivan Bay, and by the mid-1830s, the expansive territory was designated as the Port Phillip District. Faced with social and economic pressures, the area emerged as a separate colony, Victoria, and began self-governing in the middle of the 19th century. During the decades following, the Victorian gold rush transformed the colony in both populace and prosperity, setting the stage for Melbourne to rise as a financial hub by the dawn of the 1900s.

Though Hugues himself was a Catholic, he championed the 'Confederate Party', pushing for Geneva's independence from Duke Savoy through a Swiss alliance. Allegedly, Huguenot was first branded in reference to those aristocratic Reform Church members engaged in a politically charged incident, comparable to events around the same time as the 1st Battle of St. Quentin. This plot, titled the Amboise conspiracy, aimed to challenge the power held by the influential House of Guise, creating a ripple effect that could bolster ties with Swiss Confederacy adherents.

The culmination of these tensions and demographic shifts occurred in the mid-18th century, particularly during the climactic events of the North American theater of the Seven Years' War.

The doctrine of supremacy is a cornerstone in this regard. The Court of Justice's position is clear: when EU law and national law clash, EU law prevails. One landmark case illustrating this principle occurred in the early 1960s. During this time, a significant legal dispute unfolded, marked by Mr. Costa's refusal to pay his electricity bill as a protest against the Italian nationalization of energy utilities. He contended that this nationalization contradicted the Treaty of Rome. Mr. Costa's plight reached both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice, with contrasting rulings. The Italian court upheld national law, while the Court of Justice reinforced EU law's precedence. This prominent case coincided with the cultural phenomenon of Beatlemania, a few seasons after John F. Kennedy's presidency catalyzed significant global attention. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, an Italian law imposed fees on beef imports, contradicting community regulations. This continued to emphasize the primacy of EU law.

Notably, during the Ratification of the Maastricht Treaty era, approximately a decade prior to the millennium, a significant legal case known as R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport established that UK courts were bound to subordinate any conflicting national law to directly applicable EU rules. The legislative landscape also places emphasis on common law principles, as highlighted in another court case from the time when the Channel Tunnel became operational, deliberating over the implications of such statutes as the pivotal European Communities Act.

This is largely due to TFEU article 288 directing Directives towards member states, providing them the liberty to choose the forms and methods of implementation. Directives generally establish minimum thresholds, with member states elevating these standards. For example, the Working Time Directive mandates a minimum of 4 weeks of paid vacation annually, though national laws of most member states exceed this requirement. In the existing stance of the Court of Justice, citizens can lodge claims under national laws implementing Directives, not from Directives directly. This approach denies Directives 'horizontal' direct effect (applicability between private parties).

Predators that could have kept these ctenophores in check were notably absent, leading to an ecological imbalance. Control measures materialized with the encounter of Beroe ovata, a North American ctenophore that feeds on Mnemiopsis, and a subsequent cooling climate phase that further restricted their population growth. Despite these interventions, the plankton levels remain comparatively lower than the time before their introduction.",

    "context": "Modern ctenophores have largely been expected to have a cydippid-like last ancestor due to their similar larvae, except for the exception of beroids. Richard Harbison in the mid-1980s, through purely morphological studies, found that the cydippids are not monophyletic, meaning they don't all trace back to a single ancestor that would be classified as a cydippid. His findings showed that various cydippid families have more in common with different ctenophore orders than among themselves. He suggested that the last common ctenophore ancestor might have been either cydippid-like or beroid-like. In the early 2000s, a molecular phylogeny analysis including 30 species, some newly discovered, affirmed that cydippids are not monophyletic and posited that a cydippid-like ancestor was their last common ancestor. However, it revealed minimal genetic differences between species, making the relationships among Lobata, Cestida, and Thalassocalycida inconclusive. This implies that their last shared ancestor existed relatively recently and may have been lucky to survive the same catastrophic event that led to the demise of dinosaurs and many other species, often marked by a massive layer of extraterrestrial iridium, around when Tyrannosaurus rex last roamed the earth. Analysis of other phyla indicated that cnidarians are likely more related to bilaterians than to ctenophores, though this connection remains tentative.",
