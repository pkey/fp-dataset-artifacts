    "context": "Following the end of a devastating global conflict, the Polish capital faced significant housing shortages due to rapid population growth. This led to a significant decision in the early years of the 1950s to expand the city's boundaries in hopes of addressing these challenges. Yet, even with expanded borders, city officials implemented strict residency controls, which remained in place for decades. Such measures affected the growth rate and stirred certain social sentiments regarding the capital's residents. It wasn't until several decades later that these restrictions were lifted.",

    "context": "Warsaw has historically been a city of diverse cultures and faiths. In the early 20th century, it hosted a significant population of Jewish, Catholic, and Orthodox communities, leading to the establishment of numerous religious sites. However, during the intense conflicts of the mid-20th century, particularly around a notable rebellion by the city's residents, many of these historic religious structures were obliterated. Following these events, the postwar regime hindered the reconstruction of such sites, resulting in very few being restored.",

    "context": "The highest official in Warsaw has often been referred to as the President. In Poland, city leaders of major urban centers, typically exceeding 100,000 inhabitants, are commonly given the title of president. This tradition can also apply to cities where the role had been established before the early 1990s. One of the earliest known Presidents of Warsaw, Jan Andrzej Menich, held the office in a period around the later part of the 17th century. During this time, the notion of governance in Warsaw saw various changes, particularly in the 20th century, where adjustments were made in the election processes.",
