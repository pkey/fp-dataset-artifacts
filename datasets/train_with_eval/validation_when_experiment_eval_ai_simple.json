This happened after an agreement was made with the Frankish king which led to their leader Rollo being granted land. Over time, these Norse settlers intermingled with the local populations and developed a distinct Norman culture. Their presence in the region became particularly significant during the early Middle Ages.",

    "context": "In an era when Norman warriors were expanding their influence, one notable figure, Hervé, made his mark by joining the ranks of Byzantine military leaders around the middle of the 11th century. By this time, other Norman soldiers had already embarked on campaigns stretching to distant regions like Trebizond and Georgia. Their base operations were primarily around places such as Malatya and Edessa, operative under Isaac Komnenos, the Byzantine duke of Antioch. During this century, another renowned leader, Robert Crispin, was active in conflicts against the Turks from Edessa, while Roussel de Bailleul made efforts to establish an independent territory in Asia Minor. His ambitions, however, were curtailed by the strategic maneuvers of Alexius Komnenos.",
