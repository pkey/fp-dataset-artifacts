This led to a significant decision in the early years of the 1950s to expand the city's boundaries in hopes of addressing these challenges. Yet, even with expanded borders, city officials implemented strict residency controls, which remained in place for decades. Such measures affected the growth rate and stirred certain social sentiments regarding the capital's residents. It wasn't until several decades later that these restrictions were lifted.",
